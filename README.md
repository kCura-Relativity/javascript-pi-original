Open Source Community: This application shows an example of how to use a Page Interaction event handler and JavaScript to connect a change event on an html element.  The code responds to a change event by dynamically showing the input box that corresponds to a choice in the drop down.  The event handler only files in edit mode on the object and there is no Pre Load event handler to set proper display if value is on field.  There is also no logic from submitting info entered into the hidden inputs.  I hope one day to turn this into a tool where you can test out JavaScript without having to create the Page Interaction event handler just to do it.
